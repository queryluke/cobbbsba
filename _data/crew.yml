  offense: Attacking a town because it was infringing upon the swamp he calls home.
  running: ...he wants to get back out into the world to kick people out of his swamp.
  backstory: >-
    Bargus was a noble mountain dwarf but as a teen he wanted more out of life
    than sitting in the mountain. So, he went to the exact opposite of a mountain, the swamp. After years
    of studying the swamp and all of its inhabitants, he was keenly aware of the impact that the local
    arcane magic factory was having on its sensitive ecosystem.  So, he decided to take matters into his own
    hands and attack the root cause of the issue but the wizarding community in the town captured him and
    imprisoned him.

  player: Hugh
  race: Tabaxi
  class: Warlock
  level: 6th

  offense: >-
    Second Chance was arrested in <city name> after he used the same M.O. to commit a crime one too many times.
    He would befriend a wealthy mark, get himself invited to some kind of event (a dinner, a soiree, a high-end card
    game) then cast "Enemies Abound" during the event to cause chaos and panic. During the resulting fracas he would
    make off with as much loot as possible.
  running: >-
    ...quite frankly, prison is boring and he's tired of pacing his cell like a caged tiger (which he thinks of himself
    as, although he's certainly not).
  backstory: >-
    Second Chance grew up as an adoptee of a dwarven clan where he learned the craft of jeweling. He found that he very
    much enjoyed the shiny jewels but got bored of the actual jeweling. He made a pact with an Archfey to gain power
    that he could use to procure more trinkets. He doesn't know why his patron is interested in him collecting rare
    gemstones, but is happy to use his borrowed powers to gather more of them.
