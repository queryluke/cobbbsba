- name: Bargus Fireforge
  img: bargus.jpg
  player: Grant
  race: Mountain Dwarf
  class: Druid
  level: 13th
  link: https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/GoldClink/characters/20801502
  offense: Attacking a town because it was infringing upon the swamp he calls home.
  running: ...he wants to get back out into the world to kick people out of his swamp.
  backstory: >-
    Bargus was a noble mountain dwarf but as a teen he wanted more out of life
    than sitting in the mountain. So, he went to the exact opposite of a mountain, the swamp. After years
    of studying the swamp and all of its inhabitants, he was keenly aware of the impact that the local
    arcane magic factory was having on its sensitive ecosystem.  So, he decided to take matters into his own
    hands and attack the root cause of the issue but the wizarding community in the town captured him and
    imprisoned him.

- name: Second Chance
  img: second.jpg
  player: Hugh
  race: Tabaxi
  class: Warlock
  level: 6th
  link: https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/Swampson/characters/20820753
  offense: >-
    Second Chance was arrested in <city name> after he used the same M.O. to commit a crime one too many times.
    He would befriend a wealthy mark, get himself invited to some kind of event (a dinner, a soiree, a high-end card
    game) then cast "Enemies Abound" during the event to cause chaos and panic. During the resulting fracas he would
    make off with as much loot as possible.
  running: >-
    ...quite frankly, prison is boring and he's tired of pacing his cell like a caged tiger (which he thinks of himself
    as, although he's certainly not).
  backstory: >-
    Second Chance grew up as an adoptee of a dwarven clan where he learned the craft of jeweling. He found that he very
    much enjoyed the shiny jewels but got bored of the actual jeweling. He made a pact with an Archfey to gain power
    that he could use to procure more trinkets. He doesn't know why his patron is interested in him collecting rare
    gemstones, but is happy to use his borrowed powers to gather more of them.

- name: Hot

  player: Brian
  race: Genasi
  class: Ranger, Fighter, Warlock
  level: 8th/2nd/6th
  link: https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/AgentSuarez/characters/20968730
  offense: >-
    Previously was an advisor to the king, but eventually lost his temper with the king and burned off his clothes in court.
  running: >-
    He's a genasi! What's the worst that could happen?
  backstory: >-
    Hot has spent many years training in different areas to come to understand the world better. As a fire genasi,
    he has a predilection for the magicks and mysteries of nature, but life has drawn him a different route-to the
    royal courts of man. He has been a sly and shrewd advisor to several royals but has been known to be a bit testy
    when ignored or dismissed. This hot-headed confidence in his own righteousness finally came back to bite him.

- name: Otzi, the God Killer
  img: otzi.jpg
  player: Daniel
  race: Yuan-ti
  class: Barbarian
  level: 16th
  link: https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/NerdsworthAcademy/characters/20993526
  offense: >-
    Otzi was imprisoned while attempting to con a few of the dirty non-Yuan-ti in a game of dice. Even the mighty
    snake-folk need to eat, and sometimes they need coin to do so (if they aren't eating the lesser peoples,
    of course). He failed to convince the onlookers his die wasn't rigged (it was), and decided it may be beneficial
    to play along with being "imprisoned".
  running: >-
    Otzi cannot be stopped; his will prevents it. Neither the crumbling walls of the prison nor the weak minds of its
    jailers can contain him. Otzi finds their beliefs to the contrary quaint, if misguided. If he wished, he would
    break the bars with his heroic strength. Or convince the guards to let him go freely. Or, simply tap his Cubic Gate
    and slither away into another plane. No, Otzi is here because he wants to be here.
  backstory: >-
    This prison and its blood games may give Otzi the opportunity to find other individuals who will help him with his
    quest. Perhaps one or two of the other combatants will be worthy as companions, or perhaps as useful idiots, or
    as food. Only death can release him from his holy mission, and death does not come easily to the God Killer.
    For he serves only Dendar, the Night Serpent, and all other gods and goddesses are paltry imitations of power,
    and will fall before his mighty serrated greatsword, the Deathsaw.

- name: Horrich
  img: horrich.png
  player: Cam
  race: Aasimar
  class: Rogue
  level: 5th
  link: https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/Kaokesi/characters/21060456
  offense: >-
    Brother framed him for his father's murder.
  running: >-
    To be free and kill my brother.
  backstory: >-
    Horrich comes from a long line of Aasimar Scourgers who have created a powerful Knightly Order of Fiend
    Slayers. He was born premature and unhealthy but with a hereditary symbol that marks me to be the future leader of the
    order. His older brother was jealous and had Horrich framed for their father's murder.
    His symbol is shaped sort of like an apostrophe combined with an apostrophe.  It is quite elaborate in design.
