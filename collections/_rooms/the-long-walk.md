    You finally feel a small respite from the intense heat, the stone floor is cool to the touch. But with the
    cool air comes the stench of rotten flesh.

##### Potion Room
As the player's enter, a strange looking robed figure looks up from a table:

"Ah, you've finally made it! Took you long enough. You need to drink those potions over there, one each, and then solve the
riddle."

He goes back to his reading.

Once all players have, consumed a potion, Talur looks up from his books and says (exasperatedly),
"Congrats! You've all been cursed. Let the guessing game begin...you must guess your curses."

Notes:
- Killing Talur will end all the curses and drop the boss key.
- Guessing 3 curses will drop the boss key and end the curses. Talur will reward with some potions.

Curses:
