description: >- 
    The room is well lit by sconces along the walls. The immediate feature you notice are three 20ft tall statues.
    To the north, a gilded soldier shackled to a large warhammer. To the east, a wooden totem pole with an ornate eye atop.
    To the west, a stone owl with a carved out opening in its midsection. In the center of the room, a simple wooden table
    has four items atop it: a large black cloak, three stubs of charcoal, a silver eff, and 50 feet of mithril rope.
